               <h4>My competition are other websites that have dinosaur information and something the do right is having multiple dinosaurs and something the do wrong is include animals that lived with the dinosaurs that are not dinosaurs like the flying reptiles and marine reptiles. How I will do better is only put actual dinosaurs so people do not confuse other animals with each other.</h4>
